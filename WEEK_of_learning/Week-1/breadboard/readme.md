The top and bottom holes of a row in a breadboard are connected horizontally, and the center part is connected vertically, as shown below:

instead of directly joining wire with solder or twisting (which creates a mess) we can use a breadboard to make connections between different components .  
we generally put power and ground wires in the vertical rails so that we can easily power any component, and for connecting two or three wires together we use horizontal rows of the breadboard. we can also directly put some ic or development board in between of breadboard for easier connections.

breadboard is generally used for prototype and testing of project , or for less refined project.
benifits of using breadboard are :
1. Reusable 
2. light weight
3. inexpensive
4. easy to use
5. quick modification capability
6. temporary prototype
