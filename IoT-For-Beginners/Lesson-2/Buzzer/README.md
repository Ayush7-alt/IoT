# Buzzer
A piezo buzzer is mostly used in a beep or a tone for a single signal.

Arduino buzzer comprises an outer case with two pins to attach it to power and ground. Inside is a piezo element, there is a ceramic disc covered with a metal (usually bronze) vibration disc. Once the current is supplied, the ceramic disk is made to contract or expand.

This then makes the surrounding disk to vibrate. Thatâ€™s the output and creates the sound you hear. The vibration rate varies by regular changes of the buzzer frequency, and the pitch of the resulting sound also changes.
