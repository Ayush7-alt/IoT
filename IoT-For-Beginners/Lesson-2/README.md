# BASIC COMPONENTS
<p> In this lesson we are going to learn about basic components that make up our project. These Include :</p>

1. [MOTORS]()
2. [SWITCHES]()
3. [RELAY]()
4. [POTENTIOMETER]()
5. [TRANSISTOR]()
6. [BUZZER]()
7. [BATTERIES]()

From these basic components we can start building fundamental projects and get started in field of iot.
Some projects from which you can learn are :
