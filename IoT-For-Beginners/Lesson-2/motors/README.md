# MOTORS AND ACTUATORS

<p>There are many different types of motors and actuators available in the market which serves different purpose.Some of the motors are given below.</p>

### Brushed DC Motor
Brushed DC motors are one of the simplest types of DC motor. It uses brushes to deliver current to the motor windings through mechanical commutation.
It has advantages like low construction cost, inexpensive controller, simple to use.  
but also have few disadvantages like less efficiency, electically noisy, low lifespan.

### Brushless DC Motor
A brushless DC motor (also known as a BLDC motor or BL motor) is an electronically commuted DC motor which does not have brushes. The controller provides pulses of current to the motor windings which control the speed and torque of the synchronous motor.  
these motors are highly efficient and can produce large amount of torque over a vast speed range.
They are known for smooth operation and holding torque when stationary.

### Geared DC motor
A geared DC Motor has a gear assembly attached to the motor. The speed of motor is counted in terms of rotations of the shaft per minute and is termed as RPM .The gear assembly helps in increasing the torque and reducing the speed. Using the correct combination of gears in a gear motor, its speed can be reduced to any desirable figure.


### Servo Motor
A servo motor is a linear or rotary actuator that provides fast precision position control for closed-loop position control applications. Unlike large industrial motors, a servo motor is not used for continuous energy conversion.    
Servo motors have a high speed response due to low inertia and are designed with small diameter and long rotor length. 

### Stepper Motor
A Stepper Motor or a step motor is a brushless, synchronous motor which divides a full rotation into a number of steps. Unlike a brushless DC motor which rotates continuously when a fixed DC voltage is applied to it, a step motor rotates in discrete step angles.  
The stepper motor can be controlled with or without feedback.

### DC Linear Actuator
Actuators are key devices used in all those applications that demand smooth linear motion. These actuators are distinguished by their used power source, as well as screw type. A linear actuator that is driven by a DC power source is known as a DC linear actuator.
