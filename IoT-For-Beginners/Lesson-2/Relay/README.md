A Relay is an electromechanical device that can be used to make or break an electrical connection. It consists of a flexible moving mechanical part which can be controlled electronically through an electromagnet, basically, a relay is just like a mechanical switch but you can control it with an electronic signal instead of manually turning it on or off.
